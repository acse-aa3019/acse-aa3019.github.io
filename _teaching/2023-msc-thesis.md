This project was conducted as part of my project in my postgraduate MSc course. I developed a package for eigenmode analysis of micromagnetic systems. This allowed users to find the resonant modes of computationally simulated micromagnetics systems like skyrmions when excited by a Zeeman field. Bloch point eigenmode analysis was also conducted.

Abstract
========
Computational micromagnetics is a well-researched field but lacks open source eigenmode analysis tools, which requires researchers to often step out of the simulation tool environment and develop post-processing scripts themselves. Hence, creating such a tool will allow for more convenient ways of exploring resonant modes. Therefore, in this work, we developed open source eigenmode analysis tools for ringdown and eigenvalue methods and integrated them in UBERMAG, exposing eigenmode simulations to the Python ecosystem. We demonstrate our simulation tools by exploring the eigenmodes of a stable Bloch point, in the system of two stacked discs of different chirality.
