This project was conducted as part of my final year project in my undergraduate BSc course. It used deep learning (DL) alongside molecular dynamics (MD) to help analyse for a more accurate model to distinguish between various phases of water and ice in quasi-liquid layers (QLLs).

Abstract
========
This paper describes the machine learning algorithm, DeepIce, created to distinguish between different phases of ice. The design of the algorithm is also shown. The Steinhardt parameters are mentioned as a precursor to DeepIce and how it sought to solve the same problem using only spherical harmonics compared to the four different neural networks used by DeepIce. To utilise this machine learning algorithm, the mW potential was used to simulate data with LAMMPS in order to train DeepIce’s artificial neural network and predict phases of H2O when presented with a simulated slab of ice containing quasi-liquid layers (QLLs). Examples of various tools including VMD and its plugins are discussed as a means to visualise DeepIce’s predictions and observe radial pair distribution functions and diffusion coefficients of the different phases. Furthermore, the results produced using the mW potential to calculate the thickness of the QLLs are analysed both visually and numerically. They are also compared against results produced by the TIP4P/Ice model from earlier reports regarding DeepIce. DeepIce was used to show ice nucleation at a molecular level. The implementation of DeepIce as well as the analysis of QLLs were the aims of the paper and, hence, these were achieved to show results such as the QLL thickness of the Basal < Primary Prismatic < Cubic slabs.
